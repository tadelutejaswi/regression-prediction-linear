# Linear Regression Prediction Project

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for predicting salary based on years of experience. It includes the following steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training and prediction
- Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared
- Visualization of the regression model

## Dataset

The dataset contains two columns:
- **YearsExperience**: The years of experience of the employee.
- **Salary**: The corresponding salary of the employee.
